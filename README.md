The purpose of this repo is to build the case for performing a hostile fork along the same lines as Hive.io

If the community decides to move forward development will occur in this repo.

The rationale for forking away from the toxic dynamic that exists between the larger community of NYC supporters and a single individual - who we will identify hearafter by one of his many aliases - Scryptenthusiast - will be outlined here.

Scryptenthusiast is an early miner who accumulated an estimated 10 Billion NYC between 2014 and 2017.  Scryptenthusiast used his whale status to manipulate the market using various pump and dump promises, such as the oft promised ATMs (there are many more examples that will be itemized as time allows).

Initially we will focus on Scryptentusiasts relationship with Yobit - considered by many to be a scam exchange:

That Scryptenthusiast is major whale and in a position to manipulate the market on Yobit is well established by documentation he posted in the Bitcointalk thread he uses to promote Yobit and himself. Using methods we will document at a later date we were able to reach a reasonable guestimate of how much NYC Scryptenthusiast had trapped on Yobit when the exchange stopped all withdrawals - the number calculated was ~7 Billion NYC.

[Bitcointalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2016963.msg53806740#msg53806740)

7 Billion is a significant enough amount to provide a motive for the continued efforts by Scryptenthusiast to use his social media presense to drive traffic to Yobit and to attempt to discredit the broader community members and developers who advise against any dealings with Yobit.

We will also outline the history of attacks against developers working to improve the codebase and make the case that developers are disincentivised to work on this project due to the perception that it isn't worth the expenditure of scarce resources when the work is undermined by personal attacks, unfounded accusations and loss of value on the project itself from being associated with scam like behavior.

Update April 21, 2020 - Scryptenthusiast has now revised his critque and focused on me which is good news for the rest of the team. My primary role has always been code-review, testnet support and web-development.

I'm also the primary laison and trouble shooter for mining pool issues (Prohashing and Mining Dutch) as well as the primary point of contact for Graviex and SouthXchange. During the 51% attack I was the one who raised the alarm when the hashrate spikes started and it was me that traced the double-spends.  I'm also the one who tracked the funds and worked with Graviex to lock them up and subsequently used those funds along with my own to pay the bounty for the latest code update that will bring us into parity with the latest bitcoin, allowing us to fulfill our roadmap.

I'm also the guy who opened up an investigation with google into the malware injection and worked with other coin repos who were similarly attacked to devise strategies and tools to prevent it from happening again while scryptenthusiast offered "inside tips" to smear the team to gullible tech reporters who then posted a poorly researched article.  If you want the real story see [Timeline, analysis, and response to recent 51% attack](https://medium.com/@newyorkcoin/timeline-analysis-and-response-to-recent-51-attack-941da50d625c).

I also devote significant time to support the community and answer questions. One that often comes up is "why can't I withdraw my funds from Yobit".  If scryptenthusiast would stop shilling Yobit our paths would never cross but part of my support role is to help the community avoid scams, bad actors and pump and dumps.  I've posted [more than 5 thousand messages](https://mee6.xyz/leaderboard/422889178989199362) on the community discord, the bulk of which are responding to questions.
 
To be honest, this repo was stood up as a joke because scryptenthusiast kept posting everywhere he could that I was only allowed to edit readme files, but the community reponse to this toungue-in-cheek effort has been ovewhelmingly positive so once we have had time to conduct a poll and get sufficient buy-in from the community, pools and exchanges it's starting to look more and more like it's going to happen.  So if scryptenthusiast is going to focus his rage on me and that means I'm going to have to take one for the team then so be it.

Additional Measures:

* Identify stranded funds remaining on exhanges that were 51% attacked [Yobit, TradeSatoshi, Crex24]
* Identify funds stranded by the shutdown of Coingather
* Investigate the feasibility of freezing and redistribution of those funds as mining rewards or removing those funds via coin-burn
