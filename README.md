The purpose of this repo is to build the case for performing a hostile fork along the same lines as Hive.io

If the community decides to move forward development will occur in this repo.

The rationale for forking away from the toxic dynamic that exists between the larger community of NYC supporters and a single individual - who we will identify hearafter by one of his many aliases - Scryptenthusiast - will be outlined here.

Scryptenthusiast is an early miner who accumulated an estimated 10 Billion NYC between 2014 and 2017.  Scryptenthusiast used his whale status to manipulate the market using various pump and dump promises, such as the oft promised ATMs (there are many more examples that will be itemized as time allows).

Initially we will focus on Scryptentusiasts relationship with Yobit - considered by many to be a scam exchange:

That Scryptenthusiast is major whale and in a position to manipulate the market on Yobit is well established by documentation he posted in the Bitcointalk thread he uses to promote Yobit and himself. Using methods we will document at a later date we were able to reach a reasonable guestimate of how much NYC Scryptenthusiast had trapped on Yobit when the exchange stopped all withdrawals - the number calculated was ~7 Billion NYC.

7 Billion is a significant enough amount to provide a motive for the continued efforts by Scryptenthusiast to use his social media presense to drive traffic to Yobit and to attempt to discredit the broader community members and developers who advise against any dealings with Yobit.
